# HandPoseEstimation
This code used mediapipe library developed by google & a tool drawables. This programme works in a pretty simple way. this programme do
1) capture a  photo (freezes it)
2) process that photo (detects hand landmarks & other)
3) then drawable tool is used to draw red marks over the hand landmarks
4) then unfreeze the photo

this process happens too fast so this looks like a video
